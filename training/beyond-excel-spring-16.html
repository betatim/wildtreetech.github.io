      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>In three days participants will learn how to go from messy data to
        generating automated reports with interactive graphics. The course is
        highly interactive, hands-on and strictly limited to six participants.
        It will cover cleaning, analysing and visualising data from the
        <a href="https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/">humanitarian data exchange</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Why take part?</h3>
      <p>You, your organisation and your stakeholders need a clear and easily
        understandable view of the vast amount of raw data collected in the
        humanitarian domain in order to ensure that you correctly recognize
        priorities, are able to analyse the impact of your activities and the
        rapidly changing world humanitarian situation. Producing such analyses
        "by hand" is both costly in manpower and error prone, neither of which
        are acceptable in this resource challenged field.
      </p>
