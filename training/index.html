          <h3>Open Courses</h3>
          <p>Courses open to the public.</p>
            <h4>Deep learning for developers</h4>
            <p>
              An one day course for software developers with no prior
              machine-learning experience. We will use deep-learning to recognise
              a player's hand gesture to implement a game of rock-paper-scissors.
              You will use <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://keras.io">keras</a>,
              and <a href="#">OpenCV</a>.
              <br />

            <h4>Deep learning from scratch</h4>
            <p>
              An intense one day course that starts with implementing a deep neural network
              from scratch and finishes with state of the art tools like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>
              and <a href="https://keras.io">keras</a>.
              Designed for working data scientists who want
              to take their understanding to the next level.
          </p>
              <h4>Modern machine-learning for businesses</h4>
              <p>A five day
                course that will get you up to speed with modern techniques
                and libraries. We will cover general techniques, and use
                <a href="#">pandas</a>,
                <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, and <a href="https://keras.io">keras</a>
                to build solutions for real world business problems.
                Designed for professional software developers, data-scientists,
                scientists, and engineers.
            </p>

          <p>We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Come prepared to
              write code. We will alternate between a short lecture, writing code,
              and short demos over the course of each day. After each iteration
              sample solutions are distributed so that at the end of the day
              you will have a working project.
          </p>
          <p>Courses are designed with developers, scientists, engineers,
            entrepreneurs, financial analysts, and data scientists
            in mind. Content is fine tuned for each audience.
            If you would like to learn
            how to use modern software tools in your specific work
            environment, you are the target audience!
          </p>
          <p>Instructors speak fluent English and German.</p>
