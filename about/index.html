            quality engineering for clients all around the world. We have

          <h3>Communication</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Wild Tree Tech knows that technology without communication and
            empathy does not work. Using our training as physicists and experience
            leading international teams we first analyse the situation before
            proposing a course of action. We are driven by solving problems that real
            humans have.

          <h3>Open Source</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Wild Tree Tech lives open source. Not only do we use it to implement our client's projects, we have also created and actively lead some of the most advanced projects in the PyData ecosystem. Including <a href="http://mybinder.org">mybinder.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub">BinderHub</a>.</p>
          <p>By being part of large, international, and open communities we have a lot of experience managing diverse teams at scale and have insight to the trends of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Using open source products means client projects have a solid foundation, benefit from the development of new ideas, and are not locked in to a particular vendor.</p>
