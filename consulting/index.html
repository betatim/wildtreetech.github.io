          <h3>Performance Review</h3>
          <p>Is your machine-learning model not performing as expected? Let
              me help you figure
              out why. I will take a deep dive into your infrastructure and
              compile a detailed PDF report about the issues I find. You can
              use this report to fix these problems on your own, or hire me to
              do it for you. This package also includes two consultations: one
              preliminary call, and another call to review your report.
