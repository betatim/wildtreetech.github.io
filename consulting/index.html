          <h3>60-Minute Consultation Call</h3>
          <p>Planning your next big startup idea and need technical advice?
              Don't know how to integrate AI in your product? Need
              recommendations for your data-science team? Need a second pair of
              eyes? I am happy to use my years of industry experience to give
              you an expert opinion. Let's jump on a call! After an email
              exchange and some research on my part, we will review your current
              situation and figure out a brief roadmap for solving your problems.
              You will receive a recording of the call and a brief written
              recap of key points.

          <h3>Production Readiness Review</h3>
          <p>Is your machine-learning model not performing as expected in
              production? Not sure how to improve an existing model? Let me
              help you figure out why. I will take a deep dive into your
              infrastructure and compile a detailed document about the issues
              I find. You can use this report to fix these problems on your own,
              or hire me to do it for you. This package includes two
              60-minute consultation calls: one preliminary call, and another
              call to review your report.

            <p>Want to get your product idea to market? I can help you build
                your Minimum Viable Product within a couple of weeks. Together
                we will figure out the necessary features and a roadmap to bring
                them to life. Afterwards I will work with you to implement your

                users.

            <h3>Team Tune Up</h3>
            <p>Your existing team is your most valuable resource. Want to
                maximise the potential of your team? Want to refresh how they
                use their tools? I am here to help. We will review your entire
                development workflow, evaluate the strengths of each team member,
                and put together a roadmap for future improvements. I will embed
                with your team two days a week, working with them in their day
                to day work, but also standing back and reviewing. The minimum
                requirement is a team of 3 people or more.
                <br />
                <em>
                   Team tune ups start at CHF9600/month and usually lasts for 2-3 months. We can also discuss <a href="/training/">one-off events</a>. <a href="/index.html#contact">Get in touch for details</a>
