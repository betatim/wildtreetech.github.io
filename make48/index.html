          <h3>Make48 - prototypes in just 48hrs</h3>
          <p>Our mission is to change how you see data at your organisation.
            Remove all the inefficient structures and pointless procedures and
            together we can explore new possibilities, build working prototypes
            and gain actionable insight super quick. In just 48 hours.
          </p>
          <h4>How it works</h4>
          <p>You set your team and me a challenge. Then,
            we spend two days researching and building. Rather than just sitting
            around talking we meet people, research, brainstorm and test our
            ideas with small prototypes. At the end you will have more than just
            a report and some slides, you will have a real prototype that you
            can use and experiment on.
          </p>
          <h4>Details</h4>
          <p>We agree on a time slot that suits everyone. I will travel to your
            site for the duration of the 48hrs. At the start
            you present the challenge, together with some of your staff I work
            on the challenge for exactly 48hrs. At the end we present the
            outcomes. You cover travel and hotel, I bring my experience.
          </p>
          <h4>Aren't 48 hours too short?</h4>
          <p>
            This is not about rockstar
            employees pulling all nighters. It is about being methodological
            and tackling risky and innovative projects within a fixed time frame.
            We can not build a product ready for launch in 48hrs, but I believe
            incredible results can be achieved in a very short time. By limiting
            yourself to 48hrs you reap all the benefits of learning from innovative
            projects and reduce the drawbacks.
