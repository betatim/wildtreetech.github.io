          <h3>What can machine-learning do for your project?</h3>

          <p>Does your project have data in the form of prose? Faced with a
            large number of documents to process manually? Are you trying to
            model a real world process? Why not use your historical records to learn
            something new about your project, or even make predictions for
            the future!
          </p>
          <p>Would your project require five PhD students and years of research
            time or are there off-the-shelf solutions? What can a group of
            tech savy people combined with domain experts achieve in a short
            amount of time? Attend this event and learn about the state of
            the art of big data analysis. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13Mw6DXhkG9kscJvIoAqrnpPiolnyff3gRUgjj-cXXz0/viewform">Sign up here.</a>
